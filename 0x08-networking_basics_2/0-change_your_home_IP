# Step 1: Backup the original hosts file
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak

# Step 2: Modify localhost entry to resolve to 127.0.0.2
sudo sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/127.0.0.2/' /etc/hosts

echo '8.8.8.8 facebook.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null

# Step 4: Display the updated hosts file
cat /etc/hosts

# Step 5: Inform the user to revert changes if necessary
echo "Note: If you're running this on a machine you'll continue to use, revert localhost to 127.0.0.1 after testing."

# Step 6: Restart networking service to apply changes
sudo service networking restart
